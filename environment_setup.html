                              You will think why android studio as you can develop apps on Eclipse and Visual Studio and other software are also available to develop apps. I have developing apps from 6 years and personally i prefer you to use android studio because android studio has variety of features and google officially support android studio. I have given you the link to download android studio <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Download Now</a>

                     <hr>
                     <p>You will have question about this why java for android because android app official language is kotlin but i tell you that for understanding kotlin you have to learn java. Yeah it's important to have some knowledge of java. If you haven't learn java till now. Then learn it first. I suggest you to learn java from Udemy.

                      <h2>Some extra advice from me:</h2>
                      <hr>
                      <p>
                        So from 6 years i'm using android studio and when i first started android app development i faced many issues in android app development like when i first started development i have a potato pcðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ with 2GB RAM and Dual Core Processor.Yeah it's true you can run android studio on 2GB RAM too. But you will have to be a lot of patience. So my special advice is that if your PC/Laptop supports RAM expansion upto 4/8GB then please do it. At least have a 4GB ram. The only thing if you have 2/4GB RAM is you can't use android emulator to test your apps. And note if you have 2/4GB RAM the i suggest to use linux operating system to develop apps. I have used android studio on Kali Linux and i really tell you that you will face less lagging issues on linux than windows but still you can't use android emulator only the thing is that android studio will face less lagging issue on linux. You have to use your android phone to test the apps. And my last words "Good things take time to happenðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š".
